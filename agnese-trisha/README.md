Quantum Cryptography - BB84 Protocol

Our work focused on the implementation of BB84 protocol. It is the first quantum cryptography protocol, developed in 1984 by Bennett and Brassard. It is based on photon polarisation. We also included a simulation of an eavesdropper, whose detection is founded on the no-cloning theorem and on the fact that the state is altered when measured.
